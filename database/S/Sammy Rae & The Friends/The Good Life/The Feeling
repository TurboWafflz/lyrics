There ain't nothing to write home about
There's no one in particular
Who's making you move-ah
On a monday get together
And by friday you've already fallen out of the groove-ah

You wanna get lost in the night
Gotta give in to the feeling
You wanna get lost in the feeling
Gotta give in to the night
When somebody turn around
And gave you something to believe in
You get something to prove-ah

You gotta lay it on the line
And hope it don't get to heavy
He said momma you the ground I'm walking
I don't get a straight line if we aren't going steady

I gotta get lost in the night
Gotta give in to the feeling
I wanna get lost in the feeling
Wanna give into the night

And I stole an ibuprofin from the bathroom 'cause I needed it
I felt it already

Oh, and it ain't worth it
Being hurt by loving isn't worth it
Homey, being hurt by love
Isn't worth it
Being hurt, singing la-la-la-lost in the feeling now

Listen, I don't wanna argue
Cause I know that when we get there
We get out of control-ah
When I wanna say my part
And then you take it all too hard
And then we get out on a roll-ah

I wanna get lost in the night
Gotta give in to the feeling
I wanna get lost in the feeling
Gotta give in to the night

We keep working up to nothing
I can feel the closure coming up from deep
In my soul

Oh, it ain't worth it
Being hurt by loving isn't worth it
Honey, being hurt by love isn't worth it
Being hurt, singing la-la-la-lost in the feeling now

(Lost in the feeling now)
(Here we go)

So you think you finally found
What you've believe in
Believe in
Believe in
But you leaving

And there ain't no way around it
When you're feeling
You're feeling
You're feeling
What you're feeling

Is it worth it?
Being hurt by loving, is it worth it?
Honey, being hurt by love
If I can't get with the two of us
What about the three of us
Well, it's me, myself, and I

'Cause it just isn't worth it
Being hurt by loving isn't worth it
Honey, being hurt
Woah it ain't worth it
Being hurt 'till you're la-la-la-lost in the feeling now

Said it just isn't worth it
Being hurt, by loving isn't worth it
Honey, being hurt
Woah, it ain't worth it
Being hurt 'till you're la-la-la-lost in the feeling now
